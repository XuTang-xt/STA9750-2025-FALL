Hello, my name is Xu Tang. I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I have experience in sales, business development, and data analysis, currently working at WowRobee Inc. in New York, where I focus on customer analysis and business strategy for delivery robots.

Previously, I interned at Deloitte and CITIC Securities, gaining research and financial analysis experience. I am fluent in Chinese and English, skilled in Excel, Python, and SQL, and I enjoy tennis and video editing in my free time.
